What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, the system creates a .git file within
the directory. You need to do this in order to use version control with
the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as a buffer, or intermediate, between the working
directory and the repository. When you want to add files from the work-
ing directory to the repository, you first add them to the staging area.
The staging area is valuable because if you wish to rescind an addition,
you can do so without messing up your repository with weird changes.
