When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

I would use a remote repository to save copies of my work online to
prevent data loss on my local machine. In addition, using a remote
repository would make collaborating on projects much easier.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having Git automatically update your remote repository might delete
changes that you made in the meantime, which would be an inconvenience.
You may want to work on a previous version of a repository, commit, and
then update the remote after you finish.
